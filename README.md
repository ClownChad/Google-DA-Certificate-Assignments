# Google-DA-Certificate-Assignments

As I was working through the Goolge Data Analytics Certificate, I gave myself work assignments to help hone my skills before completing my capstone project. This repository is used to store all of the raw files (spreadsheets, notes, etc.) for each project. However, if you want to see a more comprehensive detailing of each project, go to my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/clownchad/code) where I present the data with python and graphs. Each folder within this repository has a leading date on its name which is when the project was started.
